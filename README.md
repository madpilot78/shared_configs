# Shared configurations for development tools

This is a monorepository I'm puglishing for my own convenience,
containing some shared configurations I use in my projects.

Since it has public access I'm licensing it with the Unlicence.
Do whatever you want with this if it is useful to you.

Contains the following packages:

## @madpilot78/eslint-config-base

Basic [eslint](https://eslint.org) configuration I use.

## @madpilot78/eslint-config-vue

Additional configuration for projects using [vue3](https://vuejs.org).

## @madpilot78/prettier-config

Basic customizations for [prettier](https://prettier.io)
